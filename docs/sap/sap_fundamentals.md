## SAP Professional Skills (Part 1)

In SAP Professional Skills Part 1, the focus is on research, strategic thinking, and conceptual skills essential for understanding the big picture in various situations.

### Research

Research skills involve identifying problems, finding and evaluating information, analyzing data, and communicating research outcomes. Data collected can be quantitative (numerical and factual) or qualitative (descriptive and subjective), with each type having its strengths and weaknesses.

In a business context, research is essential for gaining insights into organizational structure, goals, operations, and the business environment. It's used for SWOT analysis, which assesses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and PESTLE analysis, which studies external factors like politics, economics, and technology. Research methods include primary (first-hand evidence) and secondary (existing data) research.

Research skills are valuable in various domains, from travel planning to business consulting, and highlight the significance of understanding the types of data and their applications.

The importance of crafting both close-ended and open-ended research questions is explained. Close-ended questions are suitable for quantitative research and yield data that is easy to process, while open-ended questions are ideal for qualitative research, allowing for detailed and insightful responses.

### Strategic Thinking

The use of mind maps is a valuable tool for planning projects, strategies, and goals. Mind maps are diagrams that organize information around a central concept and encourage creativity, enabling individuals to add thoughts and ideas. They are particularly useful for collaboration and teamwork.

Strategic thinking is emphasized as a rational process that involves analysis, problem-solving, planning, and effective communication. Continuous improvement of strategic thinking skills is encouraged, with recommendations to observe, reflect, ask questions, think creatively, consider the bigger picture, and propose solutions based on a thorough understanding of the situation.

### Design Thinking

Design Thinking is described as a process used at SAP for problem-solving and creative solution design, focusing on deep empathy and understanding of clients as individuals. The process structures creative thinking around this empathy to tailor solutions to the needs of people.

An example of Airbnb's success through Design Thinking is shared, where the founders identified the user's need for high-quality pictures and good descriptions, doubling Airbnb's revenue.

The Design Thinking process is then explained, consisting of five stages:

1. **Empathize**: Research the user's needs and create a persona to understand their perspective.
2. **Define**: State the user's needs and problems, building a profile of the user and their requirements.
3. **Ideate**: Challenge assumptions and generate creative ideas using techniques like mind mapping and brainstorming.
4. **Prototype**: Begin creating solutions, which can be represented as mock-ups or drawings.
5. **Test**: Assess solutions through workshops or peer review, making necessary revisions.

SAP views Design Thinking as a mindset and a human-centred approach that leverages empathy, collaboration, rapid prototyping, and continuous feedback to address problems.

### System Thinking

Systems thinking is an analytical approach to understanding complex systems, emphasizing their interconnectedness and the relationships between their various components. It involves looking at the bigger picture, considering how different elements within a system interact, and understanding the system's overall purpose or function.

Key principles of systems thinking include:

1. Interconnected Elements: Systems consist of multiple interconnected elements, where changes in one part can have ripple effects throughout the entire system.
2. Purpose-Driven: Systems are designed to achieve a specific purpose or function, and understanding this purpose is essential for effective analysis.
3. Hierarchy of Systems: Systems can exist within larger systems, forming subsystems, and these can further interact within broader contexts.
4. Leverage Points: Identifying specific elements or relationships within a system where making changes can have a significant impact on the entire system.

Systems thinking is a valuable tool for problem-solving, decision-making, and managing complex situations, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics and potential consequences within a system. It is applied in various fields, including business, environmental studies, engineering, and healthcare, to address multifaceted challenges and create more effective solutions.

## Customer Enviroment

Three essential analytical frameworks to better understand a customer's business and operating environment: PESTLE, SWOT, and VUCA.

1. **PESTLE Analysis**: This framework examines a customer's business environment from six perspectives: Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors. It helps assess how various external factors can impact a customer's operations. For example, it can be used to evaluate data protection regulations, political stability, economic conditions, and social factors like consumer preferences.
2. **SWOT Analysis**: SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. This framework is used to assess an organization's internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats). It helps in understanding how a customer can alleviate problems and seize new opportunities. For instance, strengths may include a proven low-cost model, while weaknesses may involve lower local wages in an emerging market.
3. **VUCA Framework**: VUCA stands for Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. This framework focuses on variations, risks, and changes in a business environment. It helps assess how unpredictable or complex certain situations are and how they might impact a customer. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented uncertainty and complexity to the airline industry.

Combining these frameworks can provide a comprehensive understanding of a customer's situation, enabling consultants to offer more effective guidance and solutions. Analyzing elements within these frameworks can help assess a customer's readiness and the potential positive or negative impacts of various actions.

By utilizing PESTLE, SWOT, and VUCA analyses, SAP consultants can gain valuable insights into their customers' needs and operating environments, thus enabling them to act as trusted advisors and enhance their customers' businesses.

## Business Processes and Data

Understanding the broader business landscape, including financial forecasting, cost analysis, budgets, hiring, and cuts.n Business analytics focuses on understanding the business as a whole, while BPA delves into individual processes, networks, and the interconnections between them.

1. **What is Business Process Analysis (BPA):** BPA is a detailed, multiphase evaluation of specific business processes aimed at identifying what is working well, what needs improvement, and how to make those changes. It involves creating process diagrams to visualize the steps and interconnections.
2. **Desired Outcomes of BPA:** BPA aims to achieve various outcomes, including cost savings, increased revenue, improved customer and staff engagement, more efficient workflows, and alignment with key performance indicators (KPIs).
3. **Steps in BPA:** Including defining the problem, measuring the process, analyzing the process and problem, making improvements, and controlling the new processes.
4. **BPA Methodologies:** Two widely used BPA methodologies, Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma, are introduced. These methodologies focus on data-driven analysis to reduce errors, defects, and process improvements.
5. **Understanding the "As-Is" State:** BPA begins by understanding the current state of processes, known as the "as-is" state. Visual representations using Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) are discussed to provide insights into process flow and potential improvements.
6. **Analytical Analyses Using BPMN:** How BPMN diagrams can be used for value analysis, root analysis, and gap analysis to assess process efficiency and identify areas for improvement.
7. **The Importance of Data Quality:** The role of data quality in the effectiveness of BPA and the need for accurate information to drive improvements.

## Analyzing System and Technology Environments

PESTLE analysis is a model for assessing a company's operating environment. It encompasses six key factors: Political, Economic, Social, Technology, Legal, and Environmental. Each factor can influence a company's systems and technology environments.

1. **Systems Diagrams:** Systems diagrams are a powerful tool for analyzing and understanding business process systems. These diagrams provide a high-level overview of processes, from input to output, allowing for the identification of gaps and potential improvements.
2. **Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN):** BPMN graphics are a means to visualize the systems and specific business processes used within a company. BPMN diagrams illustrate how data flows across various business processes, providing a more detailed analysis.
3. **Progression from High-Level to Low-Level Analysis:** The transition from high-level PESTLE analysis to low-level BPMN analysis, highlighting that the level of detail within each analysis increases as you move forward.
4. **Importance of Making Analysis a Habit:** Developing the habit of analysis is stressed as it enables a more comprehensive understanding of business systems and technology environments. It allows individuals to apply their observations and knowledge effectively when analyzing processes and data.

## Verbal Communication Skills

In the context of effective verbal communication skills in a consulting role, it's important to highlight the significance of active listening and empathetic listening. True understanding fosters trust and helps consultants gain deeper insights into the client's perspective and challenges.

The complementary nature of speaking and listening is emphasized, with clarity, respect, and empathy as crucial components of effective communication. Effective speaking is not just about conveying information but also about considering the audience, setting, and the relationship between the speaker and the listener.

Body language also plays a vital role in communication. Consultants should be mindful of their body language to create a comfortable and engaging environment for effective communication. Adjusting body language based on the setting, the nature of the relationship, and the specific audience is crucial.

Throughout the discussion, empathy is consistently emphasized. It is the key to truly understanding the client's needs, concerns, and perspectives. Consultants are encouraged to focus on creating a positive experience for the client and to ensure that their views and situations are accurately represented.

### Presentation Skills

Presentations can have three primary goals: to inform, instruct, and persuade. The type of presentation you give determines the specific goal, delivery style, and content format. For instance, informing involves sharing meeting outcomes, instructing occurs in training sessions, and persuading aims to both inform and convince the audience about a particular idea or product.

Choosing the right content for your presentation involves answering two essential questions: what to say and how to say it. To address the "how" aspect effectively, you must consider your target audience and use clear language. Creating a persona of an audience member or a few representative individuals helps align the presentation with audience expectations.

The "what" question is addressed by employing a time-tested presentation structure: 1. Tell them what you're going to tell them. 2. Tell them. 3. Tell them what you told them. This approach provides a clear framework: start with a captivating introduction, deliver the main content, and summarize the key points to leave a lasting impression.

## Professional Writing

Effective note-taking is a crucial skill for SAP consultants. In a world where lengthy, unstructured notes are impractical and ineffective, the ability to capture key insights, conclusions, and to-dos from conversations is essential. Notes should aim to represent the conversation's essence without being a verbatim transcription.

A structured notes template can help. It includes details like the meeting date, topic, participants, three key takeaways, and potential action items. For larger meetings, noting participant names and their physical positions can provide valuable context.

In the realm of professional writing, consultants engage in various forms of written communication, such as Teams messages, emails, and proposals. The key is brevity, clarity, and a clear objective or call to action.

When composing emails, the three-step business writing process is valuable. Step 1 involves answering fundamental questions about the email's subject, audience, and purpose. Step 2 is about outlining the text, and Step 3 focuses on the actual writing, emphasizing brevity, simplicity, active voice, and clear language. Visual aids can enhance the message.

In email communication, it's advisable to consider whether a call might be more effective than a lengthy email thread. Likewise, use discretion when sharing emails with broad audiences, ensuring that recipients are relevant.

Professional writing skills improve over time with experience. Keeping clarity, brevity, accuracy, and audience-appropriateness in mind will make you an effective business writer.
