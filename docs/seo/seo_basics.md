## Google Algorithms & Ranking

More than 90% of all search queries in the world are handled by Google. That‚Äôs why, when talking about SEO, we focus on optimizing and performance for Google since you will be reaching more people in it.

### Ranking Process

Here is the broken-down process:

- Crawling: the search engine uses ‚Äúspider crawlers‚Äù, a bot, to scour the web for new or updated content.
- Indexing: when the content is found, the spider crawlers add a copy of the new information into the search engine‚Äôs database.
- Ranking: the index is fed through the algorithm to match the best set of data within their database with the search query made by the user.
- Result: the data set is presented to the user in the form of a search engine results page.

### Ranking Factors

Here are the most important factors for ranking:

- Backlinks: the more authoritative sites that link back to a particular web page, the higher that page will rank.
- Relevant copy: your website should contain content that is relevant, related and useful to your audience.
- HTML tags: using the correct tags to build the structure of your website are a great way to improve the ranking. Also using alt tags to describe images can help the Google Image‚Äôs engine.
- Core Web Vitals: building a website with fast loads and a lot of stability helps to improve the user experience of their searches, giving it a better ranking.
- User behaviour: even though is not confirmed by Google, many SEO specialists believe that how long the user spends on your website affects the ranking.
- Mobile Optimization: Google judges equally mobile versions and desktop versions, this means that it is important for your website to be responsive.

### Algorithms factors

Google‚Äôs algorithm has a set of rules to determine now results should be presented to users. Some of its rules are:

- Meaning of your query: to return relevant results, the search engine looks at the meaning behind the user‚Äôs query.
- Relevance: when the website contains the same keywords as the user‚Äôs search, it would help to show the it more frequently to the users.
- Quality of content: it favours the most reliable (expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness) information available.
- Usability: a high usability scores means the site will appear more frequently to users.
- Context and settings: the search results might change because of related to your past history search, search settings and location.

### Optimizing for E-A-T

Keeping the content up to date, building more high-quality inbound links, making sure the content is factually accurate and written by experts are good ways of building a good SEO. That is one of the examples on optimizing your website using E-A-T:

- Expertise: this means that the content created was written by someone that has expertise on the topic.
- Authoritative: this means the content created have a author in the background that is known, that has some brand recognition.
- Trustworthy: this means users can trust the website for real and factual informations.

## Technical SEO Basics

## URLs

An URL is a web address for a website or/and a protocol (HTTPS or HTTP). It is usually broken up as:

<aside>
üåê protocol://domain-name.top-level-domain/path
</aside>

In a way that, the protocol indicates how a web browser retrieves information about a resource, the domain name (or hostname) indicates a specific location of a resource, and the top-level domain (TLD) is a sort of category for websites.

### SEO Guidelines for URL Structures

Here is how a website can be optimized by its URL structure:

- Both users and search engines should be able to read your URL
- The way you organize your content dictates your URL structure
- Do not use mixed case or sentence case when writing URLs
- Avoid using underscores and use hyphenation rather
- Avoid using trailing slashes
- Future proof your URLs

### URL Parameter Handling

The parameters of an URL are the portion that follows a question mark. They are composed with:

The most common use of parameters are for tracking, reordering, filtering, identifying, paginating, searching and translating.

URL parameters can cause search performance issues, but there are ways to make them more search engine friendly. Firstly, legacy URL parameters should be identified and removed, while preventing empty values from being added to URLs. Secondly, it is important to use keys only once and to combine multi-select options under a single key. Finally, it is recommended to order URL parameters in a consistent way to avoid crawl budget and ranking signal issues.

This approach offers several benefits, including efficient use of crawl budget, reduced duplicate content issues, and consolidated ranking signals. It is also suitable for all parameter types. However, it requires a moderate amount of technical implementation time. Asking a developer to write a script to order parameters in a consistent way can help avoid issues caused by user selection.

Another way to manage your URL parameters is through the legacy URL Parameter handling tool in Google Search console.

## ****Site Structure / Navigation / Siloing / Information Architecture****

Website structure is the way website content is organized and linked together. It is crucial for a healthy site architecture to promote a good user experience and help search engine spiders find important content easily. Websites with a clear and effective structure perform better and rank higher in search results. Information architecture is the process of organizing complex sets of information into a comprehensible and ordered structure.

A silo in site architecture occurs when there is a well-linked internal page stuck in a vertical structure with no links across. An interlinking strategy that focuses on what users might find handy in their journey around the site can solve this problem. Optimizing websites for traffic, revenue, and conversion is one of the most essential parts of SEO, and using a flat website architecture can help achieve this. A flat website architecture allows users (and search engine spiders) to reach any page on the site in four clicks or less.

Outlined below are six tips for good information architecture for SEO. Firstly, aim to match users' intent by creating content that fulfills their goals. Secondly, use Google Analytics insights to build user personas and design the website's information architecture around the target audience's desired user journey. Thirdly, design the site structure around preferred user journeys based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Fourthly, start with mobile-first and expand to desktop, putting only the most important content on the page. Fifthly, provide consistent navigation and avoid content having multiple URLs pointing to it. Finally, employ siloing/categories to map SEO keywords to pages to eliminate duplicate content and cannibalization.
